# Catch of the Day

## A [TOJam](https://www.tojam.ca/) 2025 game

Just what did you do last night anyway?  Here you are on the dock of an abandoned
fishing village with just the clothes on your back.  Even your pockets are empty.
Surely you came from somewhere.  Surely you belong somewhere.  And it definitely 
isn't here.  Maybe it wasn't abandoned all that long ago.  There are certainly plenty
of things around.  But you get the strange feeling that the more items you gather
the worse it is.  But you do need those things for your escape right?

A top down spooky adventure.

Controls: arrow keys to move, use space to pick up items or open the inventory.

How to Run:

For local development testing type:

```bash
cd src
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/
